(45, 'My name is Robert Mathisen. I started tutoring when I was in high school. Not for pay, or anything like that, but simply because there was a friend in the class that needed help. I knew at some point in my career I wanted to become a teacher, but admittedly, I wanted to keep my options open and see what I could do with my Math & Science skills. I went to New Jersey Institute of Technology where I graduated as an Industrial Engineer. I would sit in the front of all my classes, take notes, and do my work. When I learn something new, I take notes in a way that I would explain it to someone else. I was taught at a young age, "If you can explain it to someone else, then you really have the content down pat." In college, it seemed like it was nearly every exam, I would have 5 classmates asking if I would help them prep for the exams. I was, once again, unofficially tutoring my classmates now in my Physics & Engineering classes. They would tell me, "You should be a teacher."

Wherever I traveled, a trail of motivation has always been left behind, and the many lives I've touched have never ceased to thrive in my wake. This reality rises out of the fact that helping others is my ultimate purpose; I've dedicated my entire life to understanding the ingredients of success and compiling them into a replicable recipe. To me, nothing is as gratifying as teaching others to recognize their boundless potential and unleashing it.

In addition to my own personal efforts, I have also  served as a teacher and mentor in many professional settings - which has drastically enhanced my ability to make a difference. For example, while attending graduate school at an ivy league institution, I had the opportunity to teach several undergraduate college classes - such as Thermodynamics, Statics, and Strength of Materials. Such an opportunity not only showed me how people learn differently, but it also taught me how to pierce through learning barriers and make an educational impact - regardless of circumstances. This passion and talent to inspire millions of people is further enhanced by my lengthy education and vast knowledge.

My passion for mathematics, physics and teaching has motivated me to lecture high school and university students.

My approach as a teacher is to prove to students that memory is less important for an engineer, mathematician, or physicist, than learning how to tackle a problem through logical reasoning. I believe that a teacher of scientific subjects should try to develop his students’ curiosity about the subject, rather than just concentrating on acquisition of knowledge, however important that may also be.
